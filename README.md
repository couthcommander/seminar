R seminar
=======

* Run simdata.r to create datasets.

* Run examples.r to see examples in action.
  * Update work.dir to reflect your directory structure.

* See slides/examples.md for the presentation.

* The command **landslide examples.md** was supposed to create an HTML5 version, but R code examples didn't come through well.
