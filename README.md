R seminar
=======

* Run simdata.r to create datasets.
  * This creates demo_data.csv and hosp_data.csv, which are already here.

* Run examples.r to see examples in action.
  * Update work.dir to reflect your directory structure.

* See slides/examples.md for the presentation.
  * Note that code from presentation is tailored for display and may not run as-is (use examples.r).

* The command **landslide examples.md** created an HTML5 version, slides/presentation.html.
  * See [landslide](https://github.com/adamzap/landslide)
